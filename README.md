#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
-Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications and systems.
-IMPORTANCE:tailored software solutions for companies can optimise operations, streamline processes, and gain a competitive edge. Also they can make informed decisions that drive growth and profitability

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s — 1970s:
The concept of software engineering as a distinct discipline was introduced. The term “software engineering” was coined by Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist at MIT, who played a crucial role in developing software for the Apollo space program. The need for structured methodologies and processes became evident as software projects grew in complexity.
1970s — 1980s:
the establishment of various software engineering principles and methodologies. The Waterfall model, emphasizing sequential development phases, gained popularity. Additionally, the concept of modular programming emerged, promoting the creation of software components that could be reused across different projects.
1980s — 1990s:
Advancements in software engineering methodologies continued with the introduction of iterative and incremental models like the Spiral model and Rapid Application Development (RAD). Object-oriented programming (OOP) gained traction, enabling better organization and management of complex systems.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define objectives, scope, and feasibility of the software
Requirements Analysis: Gather and document user needs and specifications
Design: Architect the software's structure and user interface in relation to user requirements
Implementation: Write and integrate code that is not ambigous
Testing: Verify that the software works as intended 
Deployment: Release the product to users 
Maintenance: Update and fix issues post-release 
   

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Agile project management is an incremental and iterative practice, while waterfall is a linear and sequential project management practice

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Software Developer: Writes and implements code, troubleshoots issues, and collaborates on design and architecture.
   Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software to identify bugs, ensure functionality, and validate user requirements.
   Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, allocates resources, and facilitates communication among team members.

7. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Tools like Visual Studio Code streamline coding with features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and auto-completion.
   VCS (Version Control Systems): track changes to code, enabling collaboration e.g Git

8. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   Managing Deadlines: Use Agile methodologies for iterative progress.
   Debugging Complex Issues: Leverage tools like debuggers and logging.

9. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    Unit Testing: Verifies individual components.
    Integration Testing: Ensures components work together.
    System Testing: Tests the complete system for functionality.
    Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   involves crafting clear, specific inputs (i.e prompts) to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses.
   It is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of AI interactions.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."
   Improved Prompt: "Give a brief overview of World War II, including key events and outcomes."
   Why the Improved Prompt Works: It specifies the topic, scope, and details desired, leading to a focused and relevant AI response.
